# <Milestone Project 3>

## For my Milestone Project I have chosen to do a website that was used for booking your next best trip!

## My backend is using Node and my front end is using React. The database I am using is Mongo, and I am able to interact with my data using Mongoose. Locally my site functions. I am not able to to deploy the application currently. I will find the fix for this.

My project is meant to be a simple and easy to use application to make your trip planning more simple. I made this project as a challenge to myself to see how hard it is to build. My Application could solve many users headaches of being able to find cheap hotels, flights, etc.


## Installation
