# <Milestone Project 3>

## For my Milestone Project I have chosen to do a website that was used for booking your next best trip!

My project is meant to be a simple and easy to use application to make your trip planning more simple. I made this project as a challenge to myself to see how hard it is to build. My Application could solve many users headaches of being able to find cheap hotels, flights, etc.


## Installation

Fork the project to your repository

Click the green button that says code once you have forked the repo

Copy the link and save it

Go to the file path of your choice in the terminal
